        "description": "\tSelected Ambient Works 85-92 is the debut studio album by Aphex Twin, the pseudonym of British electronic musician Richard D. James. It was released on 9 November 1992 through Apollo Records, a subsidiary of Belgian label R&S Records. The album consists of beat-orientated ambient tracks recorded onto cassette reputedly dating as far back as 1985, when James was thirteen to fourteen years old. \n \n \t An analogue remaster of the album was released in 2006, followed by a digital remaster in 2008. Upon its release, Selected Ambient Works 85-92 received widespread acclaim. James followed up the album in 1994 with the more traditionally ambient Selected Ambient Works Volume II. In 2012, it was named the greatest album of the 1990s by Fact. It entered the UK Dance Albums Chart at number 30 after the release of Aphex Twin's 2014 album Syro.\n \n - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  \n \n \n -- marco's favorite track: delphium ",

        "description": "\t...I Care Because You Do is the third studio album by electronic musician Richard D. James under the alias Aphex Twin, released on 24 April 1995 by Warp. Containing material recorded between 1990 and 1994, the album marked James's return to a percussive sound following the largely beatless Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994), and pairs abrasive rhythms with symphonic and ambient elements. The cover artwork is a self-portrait by James. \n \n \t I Care Because You Do peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart. It was supported by the single and EP release of the track 'Ventolin'. The album received positive reviews, with Entertainment Weekly, Spin, and Rolling Stone commending it as a return to form for James. It garnered comparisons to the work of composer Philip Glass, who later re-recorded the track 'Icct Hedral' for James's 1995 EP Donkey Rhubarb. In 2017, Pitchfork ranked I Care Because You Do the 13th best IDM album of all time. \n \n - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  \n \n \n -- marco's favorite track: alberto balsalm ",

        "description": "\t Richard D. James Album is the eponymous fourth studio album by British electronic musician Richard D. James, under his pseudonym Aphex Twin. In the United Kingdom, the album was released on 4 November 1996 through Warp. In the United States, it was released on 28 January 1997 by Sire Records, with the Girl/Boy EP included as bonus tracks. A reissue on vinyl was released on 18 September 2012. \n \n \t Richard D. James Album was composed by James on his Macintosh computer, and took longer to complete than his previous efforts. The album features faster breakbeats and intricate drum programming which draw influence from jungle and drum and bass, combined with lush string arrangements, unstable time signatures, and slow ambient melodies reminiscent of James' earlier work, as well as modulated vocals by James. \n \n \t RDJA was less successful in the United Kingdom than James' two previous albums Selected Ambient Works Volume II (1994) and ...I Care Because You Do (1995). However, the album still charted in the UK, peaking at number 62 on the UK Albums Chart for one week. It also peaked at number 20 in the US Top Heatseekers list, becoming James' first to do so. The album received acclaim from music critics, and NME listed it as the 20th best album of the year. \n \n - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  \n \n \n -- marco's favorite track: - to cure a weakling child",
