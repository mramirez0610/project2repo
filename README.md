# hello! this is my data application project for n320

no music present in this project belongs to me. all right go to warp records and richard d. james, this is a passion project and counts as fair use --

all photos were downloaded from (https://aphextwin.nu), if the mod somehow comes across this i tried to get in contact with you but it seems your forum has been inactive for a couple years, i hope you are okay with me using 3 images

this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## thank you to:

my wonderful girlfriend for helping me stay calm through making this assignment. if she was not with me most of the time, i wouldn't have the motivation to 
work on this. sup isabella

my mother and my father, for not knowing anything about what i'm studying but still support me nonetheless
